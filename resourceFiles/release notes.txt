Jacob Griffin's SuperJavaPaint, Version 7.0 (Final Commit) - 11/27/2023
    New Features:
	    - Live Draw now functions correctly for "Shape".
	    - Redo and Undo are fixed.
	    - Save and Save As correctly identify the current file only, preventing accidental overwrites of other canvases.
	    - Autosave works for all tabs simultaneously.

    Known Issues:
        - Live Draw for transparent objects doesn't accurately reflect transparency level.
        - AutoSave accumulates images that are not cleared from the autoSaves folder
        - If a file is made using Save As..., it should be the current file (for saving again)
        - Thick dashed strokes appear solid
        - It can appear as if no buttons are selected if the user clicks the currently toggled button
        - Smart Save only checks the main canvas (and ignores all other tabs).

    Features to Consider:
        - Add regular polygon
        - The timer's countdown should be visible to the user (Only if they desire)
        - Add a warning when saving with an alternate file format
        - Notifications from the OS ("Corner of Windows)" for Autosave
        - Threading for Logging
